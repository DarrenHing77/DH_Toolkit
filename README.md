# DH_Toolkit

A no-bullshit Blender addon that actually does useful shit.

## What is this?

Darren Hing's personal toolkit for Blender 4.5+ that cuts through the crap and gives you tools that work. Context-aware pie menus, proper project management, FBX export that doesn't suck, and a bunch of other utilities I got tired of doing manually.

## Features

- **Pie Menus:** Context-aware menus for Object, Edit, Sculpt, Weight Paint, UV Edit, Shader Editor modes
- **Project Manager:** Creates proper folder structures like a professional (01_Ref, 02_Photoshop, 03_Blender, etc.)
- **FBX Export:** Single/multi-object export with proper versioning (because Blender's is trash)
- **Multires Tools:** Modal level adjustment, quick min/max, subdivide without the pain
- **Scene Cleanup:** Nukes overlapping duplicates, data-block dupes, and garbage mesh data
- **Shader Builder:** Auto-builds materials from texture maps with smart pattern detection
- **Mask Tools:** Extract sculpt masks with solidify, slice, and modal thickness control
- **Collection Tools:** Move objects around without wanting to die
- **Weight Paint:** Fill shells, cycle vertex groups, transfer weights like a human
- **Display Utils:** Wireframe toggle, smart hide/unhide, viewport background controls

## Dependencies

- **Easy Weight** (Free) - For advanced weight painting features
- **Modifier Tools** (Blender Default) - Integrated modifier management

## Installation

1. Download the ZIP
2. Install in Blender like any other addon  
3. Keymap defaults to `Shift+X` (change it in preferences if you want)

## Usage

Hit your keymap (default `Shift+X`) and get context menus that don't suck. Different modes show different tools - it's not rocket science.

- **Object Mode:** Project tools, mesh ops, display settings
- **Edit Mode:** Selection, modeling, UV tools, visibility 
- **Sculpt Mode:** Brushes, face sets, mask tools, multires controls
- **Weight Paint:** Brushes, vertex groups, transfer tools
- **UV Edit:** Unwrap, align, pack, transform tools
- **Shader Editor:** Node creation, material building

## Requirements

- Blender 4.5+
- Basic understanding of how Blender works
- Tolerance for slightly sarcastic UI text
