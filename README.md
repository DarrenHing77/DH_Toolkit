# DH_Toolkit

A no-bullshit Blender addon that actually does useful shit.
What is this?
Darren Hing's personal toolkit for Blender 4.5+ that cuts through the crap and gives you tools that work. Pie menus, project management, FBX export that doesn't suck, and a bunch of other utilities I got tired of doing manually.
Features

Pie Menus: Context-aware menus for Object, Edit, Sculpt, Weight Paint, UV Edit modes
Project Manager: Creates proper folder structures like a professional
FBX Export: Single/multi-object export with versioning (because Blender's is trash)
Multires Tools: Actually usable multires controls
Scene Cleanup: Nukes duplicates and garbage data
Shader Builder: Auto-builds materials from texture maps
Mask Tools: Extract and work with sculpt masks
Collection Tools: Move objects around without wanting to die

Installation

Download the ZIP
Install in Blender like any other addon
Keymap defaults to Shift+X (change it in preferences if you want)

Usage
Hit your keymap (default Shift+X) and get context menus that don't suck. Different modes show different tools - it's not rocket science.
Requirements

Blender 4.5+
Basic understanding of how Blender works
Tolerance for slightly sarcastic UI text

License
Whatever keeps lawyers happy. Use it, don't steal it, don't blame me if it breaks.
